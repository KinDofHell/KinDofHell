# Hi there 👋

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I am a creative and efficient Full Stack Developer with experience in commercial development, which includes all the processes of both frontend and backend development and their interaction.

In my work, I strive to use new technologies and opportunities, but always find a place to analyze the requirements and determine the real technical needs for a particular project. 

Working in a team of like-minded people and professionals improve me as a developer every day and allows me to reach new heights. I am known as a persistent and smart player who will offer a solution to any problem.
