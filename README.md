# Hi there 👋

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I am a front-end developer with commercial experience, gained by solving many typical and atypical problems, implementing smart and optimized solutions when working on multifunctional sites. 
My professional skills are based on HTMl/CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React/Next, as well as many UI libraries and other related development tools. 
In addition, I always find time to learn, master the Backend principles to understand when interacting with the backend of applications. I can use Node.js, Express, Nest, MongoDB and SQL. 
It is also worth noting my ability to quickly adapt and learn new things, the presence of interest and the desire to be an effective member of the team.
