# Hi there 👋

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I am a creative and efficient front-end/full stack developer with commercial experience who is ready to become a great team member and make any effort to improve the company.

I understand valid and semantic layout, have deep knowledge of javascript and typescript, worked with APIs, processed asynchronous requests. I work well with React, Next, and have a basic understanding of other frameworks. I use Redux Toolkit, Zustand, UI libraries, such as MUI and Shadcn, perfectly and optimized. I have experience in writing tests using Jest.

Also, my advantage is the education of a Full Stack developer, so I understand the processes and principles of the backend part, I know Node.js, Express, Nest, MongoDB.
